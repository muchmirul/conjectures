# Jacobian Conjecture for Baby

*A step-by-step guide, starting from zero, to a famous math problem that stayed open for 87 years and then fell in July 2026. Every idea is shown as an animation, and you can check the final discovery yourself.*

![A square grid smoothly deforming into a curved shape that can be perfectly undone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/00-start-here/hero.gif)

The animation above bends a flat grid into a strange curved shape, and at first the grid looks ruined. **This bending can be perfectly undone.** A second simple rule moves every point back to exactly where it started, so nothing is lost.

In 1939, a mathematician named Ott-Heinrich Keller asked a simple question about maps like this one. His question became one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics, and many mathematicians published proofs of it. **Every proof turned out to be wrong.** The problem stayed open for 87 years until July 2026, when it fell, though only partly and in a way nobody expected. The original two-dimensional case is still open.

This article explains the whole story from zero, so you do not need any math background. Each chapter is one small idea, explained with a picture first, and at the end you can check the 2026 discovery yourself using simple arithmetic. Everything here is backed by an open repository: [github.com/muchmirul/conjectures](https://github.com/muchmirul/conjectures/tree/main/jacobian-conjecture) holds the code for every animation and a test suite that re-checks every mathematical claim. Chapters 1 to 8 build the ideas one by one, chapter 9 states the famous question, and chapters 10 to 12 describe what happened to it.

## 1 · Functions are machines

The smallest idea we need is the idea of a **function**. A function is a machine: you feed it a number, and it gives you back a number.

![Numbers ride through the machine 'double it, then add 1' one at a time, with a scoreboard recording each trip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/01-functions-are-machines/machine.gif)

The machine above uses the rule "double the number, then add 1." Feed it 3 and you get 7, feed it 0 and you get 1, and feed it 10 and you get 21. Two conditions make a machine a function: it always gives an answer, and the same input always gives the same output, with no randomness and no "it depends".

The next picture changes the viewpoint, and the rest of the article depends on the new one. Instead of feeding the machine one number at a time, imagine it moving **every number on the number line at the same time**.

![Dots on a number line all travel simultaneously to their outputs on a second line below](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/01-functions-are-machines/numberline.gif)

It is the same machine seen a different way, as something that moves the whole line at once, and later chapters use this picture on bigger spaces. One piece of notation goes with it, and it is the only notation we need. Mathematicians name a machine with a letter like $f$ and write its rule as $f(x) = 2x + 1$, read as "$f$ takes a number $x$ and returns $2x+1$." The letter $x$ is a placeholder for the input.

> **The one thing to remember:** a function is a machine that turns each input into exactly one output, and you can picture it moving every number at once.

---

## 2 · The undo machine

A machine moves every number, and the next question is whether that move can be reversed. This is the idea the rest of the story grows from. The machine "double it" sends 3 to 6, and the machine "halve it" sends 6 back to 3, so running one after the other leaves every number exactly where it started.

![Dots travel from the input line down to their doubled outputs, then travel back up home](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/02-the-undo-machine/undo.gif)

When a second machine brings every output back to its original input, it is called the **inverse**, or the undo machine. Doubling and halving undo each other, and so do "add 5" and "subtract 5". Squaring, which multiplies a number by itself, behaves differently.

![Left: the dots minus 3 and 3 land on the same output 9. Right: the doubling dots land on separate outputs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/02-the-undo-machine/collision.gif)

Feed it −3 and you get 9, and feeding it 3 gives 9 as well. Standing at 9, there is no way to tell which input you came from, because the information about the sign has been destroyed.

An undo machine cannot exist when either of two things happens:

1. **Collisions:** two different inputs land on the same output. (−3 and 3 both land on 9.)
2. **Gaps:** some outputs are never produced, so the undo machine would have nothing to say there. (Squaring never outputs −4.)

If there are no collisions and no gaps, then every output has exactly one origin, so "walk back where you came from" is itself a machine. Those two conditions are not just enough for an undo to exist, they are exactly what an undo needs.

*(The official words, if you want them: no collisions is called **injective**, no gaps is called **surjective**, both together is called **invertible**. You can forget these words. "No collisions, no gaps" is all you need.)*

> **The one thing to remember:** a machine can be undone exactly when no two inputs share an output and no output is missing. Undoing fails the moment information is destroyed.

---

## 3 · Polynomials

So far a machine could use any rule, but the famous problem is about one specific family of machines, the ones built from nothing but plus and times. Take an input $x$ and allow yourself only two operations, adding and multiplying, using numbers or pieces you have already built. Any machine you can build this way is called a **polynomial**.

- $2x + 1$ doubles and then adds one. It is a polynomial.
- $x^2$ is $x$ times $x$. It is a polynomial, since a power is just repeated multiplication.
- $x^3 - 2x$ builds $x \cdot x \cdot x$, builds $2x$, and subtracts. It is a polynomial, since subtracting is adding a negative.

The graphs below show these three machines. For each input $x$ along the bottom, the height of the curve shows the output.

![The graphs of 2x+1, x squared, and x cubed minus 2x draw themselves; then dashed gray curves appear](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/03-polynomials/gallery.gif)

The dashed gray curves, $\sin x$, $1/x$, and $\sqrt{x}$, are **not** polynomials. Each one needs an operation we did not allow: dividing by the input, or an infinite process.

Polynomials matter here because they are the machines you can run **exactly, with pencil and paper, in a finite number of steps**. There is no approximation, nothing that is undefined at zero, and no infinite sums, which makes them the most concrete and most checkable machines in mathematics. That is also what makes the coming problem surprising, since it asks about the simplest machines we have and still defeated everyone for 87 years.

One more word is needed later on. The **degree** of a polynomial is its biggest power, so $x^3 - 2x$ has degree 3, and this word becomes important in chapter 10.

> **The one thing to remember:** a polynomial is any machine built using only plus and times. These are the most finite, most checkable machines there are.

## 4 · Maps of the plane

Machines that take one number were the warm-up, and from here the machines take **points** instead. A **point** of the plane is a pair of numbers $(x, y)$: how far right, and how far up. A **plane map** is a machine that takes a point and returns a point. A point is two numbers, so the machine has two output slots, and each slot may use both inputs: $F(x, y) = (\text{rule using } x, y,\ \text{rule using } x, y)$.

In chapter 1, a machine moved the whole number line. A plane map moves the **whole plane**, and to see it you draw a grid on the plane and watch the map carry it.

![A square grid warps smoothly, two marked dots travel with it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/04-maps-of-the-plane/rubbersheet.gif)

The plane moves like a rubber sheet. The two dots are examples: each one is picked up at $(x, y)$ and put down at $F(x, y)$. The next figure shows six basic plane maps, all moving at once.

![Six panels animate at once: the untouched plane, then slide, turn, grow, lean and bend](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/04-maps-of-the-plane/gallery.gif)

Slide, turn, grow, and lean all keep the grid lines straight. The last one, *bend*, does not, because its rule uses $y^2$ and $x^2$, and squaring is what bends lines. This connects back to chapter 3.

> A **polynomial map** of the plane is a map where both output rules are polynomials, built from $x$ and $y$ using only plus and times. For example, $F(x, y) = (x + \tfrac{1}{4}y^2,\; y + \tfrac{1}{4}x^2)$ is the "bend" panel above.

Polynomial maps of flat space are the subject of the rest of this article. The later chapters ask when such a map can be undone.

> **The one thing to remember:** a plane map moves every point of the plane at once, like a rubber sheet. It is a polynomial map when both of its rules use only plus and times.

---

## 5 · Straight maps and the area factor

Before we let maps bend anything, we need one number that comes from the simplest maps. Some plane maps are perfectly regular, because grid lines stay **straight**, stay **parallel**, and stay **evenly spaced**, and the center point does not move. These are called **linear maps**, and we will call them straight maps. The turns, grows, squeezes, and leans of the last chapter are all straight maps, and the next figure shows what each one does to the yellow square, which starts with area 1.

![Six straight maps morph the grid at once while a yellow patch shows each area factor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/05-straight-maps-and-area/gallery.gif)

The six panels all follow one pattern. A straight map scales the yellow square's area by some factor, and it scales **every** piece of the plane, everywhere, by that **same** factor.

- turn, squeeze, and lean each give area × 1
- grow, which doubles everything, gives area × 4
- mirror gives area × 1, but the square comes out flipped, like a page turned over
- squash gives area × 0, and the whole plane lands on a single line

This one number, the area-scaling factor, is called the map's **determinant**. For the mirror we record the flip with a minus sign, so its determinant is −1. The determinant therefore tells you two things at once: how much area is scaled, and whether the plane got flipped over. The case worth looking at closely is a determinant of zero.

![The grid collapses onto a single diagonal line; three marked dots merge into one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/05-straight-maps-and-area/squash.gif)

Watch the three dots. When the determinant is 0, the plane is pressed flat onto a line, so different points land on the same spot and there are collisions everywhere. Chapter 2 gives the consequence: information is destroyed, and the map cannot be undone.

When the determinant is not zero, a straight map has no collisions and no gaps, so it has an undo map, and that undo map is also straight. For straight maps, one number decides the whole matter:

> **A straight map can be undone exactly when its determinant is not zero.**

*(Where the number comes from: a straight map is fully described by four numbers, $F(x, y) = (ax + by,\; cx + dy)$. Its determinant is $ad - bc$. You will never need to compute this by hand here.)*

> **The one thing to remember:** a straight map scales all areas by one fixed factor, the determinant. If the factor is nonzero, the map can be undone. If the factor is zero, the plane is crushed and information is lost.

## 6 · Bending the grid

Now we let polynomial maps bend things, and compare two kinds of them. Some maps bend the plane without ever squeezing it, while others press area down to zero somewhere, and this difference is the center of the whole story.

Start with the first kind, the map called the **shear**:

```math
F(x, y) = (x + y^2,\; y)
```

In words, it slides each horizontal row to the right by $y^2$, so rows near the middle barely move and rows far away move a lot. The next figure follows the yellow square as the plane bends.

![A grid bends into a sideways parabola shape; a yellow unit patch deforms but visibly keeps its size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/06-bending-the-grid/shear.gif)

The grid bends, but nothing is squeezed or stretched, so every small piece keeps **exactly its area**. This map is easy to undo, because each row slid right by $y^2$, so sliding it back gives $G(x, y) = (x - y^2,\; y)$. $G$ undoes $F$ perfectly, and $G$ is itself a polynomial map, which makes this our first interesting **polynomial map with a polynomial undo**.

Stacking shears builds much wilder maps. Do a vertical shear and then a horizontal one, and the two steps together form one polynomial map:

```math
H(x, y) = (\,x + (y + x^2)^2,\; y + x^2\,)
```

![Two shears stacked produce a wild-looking curved map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/06-bending-the-grid/tangled.gif)

This is the bending from the first animation of the article. It looks complicated, but it is only two simple shears applied one after the other, so it can be undone by undoing the layers in reverse order, in the way you take off your shoes before your socks. Its undo map is again a polynomial, and in chapter 10 the computer finds it for us. You can stack as many shears and straight maps as you like, and the result looks more and more complicated while staying perfectly undoable.

The second kind of map destroys information. The next two figures show the two ways that happens.

![The plane folds like a closing book onto the right half plane; two marked dots crash into one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/06-bending-the-grid/fold.gif)

$F(x, y) = (x^2, y)$ **folds** the plane like closing a book, so the left half lands exactly on the right half. The two dots show a collision: two different points reach one landing spot, so this map cannot be undone.

![Under (x, xy) the grid morphs while the red vertical line collapses onto a single point at the origin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/06-bending-the-grid/crush.gif)

$F(x, y) = (x, x\cdot y)$ **crushes**, so the entire vertical center line collapses onto one single point. That is a collision on a grand scale, and it cannot be undone either.

Comparing the two kinds gives the pattern. The shear and the stacked shears bend but never crush, so they can be undone, with a polynomial undo, while the fold and the crush press area down to zero somewhere, which causes collisions and leaves them with no undo.

This looks like chapter 5's rule, that a map can be undone exactly when its area factor is nonzero, now extended from straight maps to bent ones. A bent map stretches area by different amounts in different places, so it has no single area factor to test. The next chapter builds a tool that reads the factor at each point separately, and that tool works like a microscope.

> **The one thing to remember:** stacked shears bend the plane into complicated shapes that are still easy to undo. Folds and crushes press area to zero somewhere, and they can never be undone.

---

## 7 · The microscope

The word that sounds hardest in this subject is the **Jacobian**, and it names a microscope for maps. To see what that means, take the curved graph of $y = x^2$ and zoom in on one point.

![A continuous zoom into the parabola at (1,1): the curve straightens until it is a straight line of slope 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/07-the-microscope/zoom1d.gif)

Under the microscope, the curve straightens out, and if you zoom in enough it looks exactly like a straight line. The slope of that line, here 2, is called the *derivative* at that point. This one observation, that smooth things look straight up close, is all the calculus you need today.

Now do the same with a bent grid. Take the stacked-shear map $H$ from the last chapter, pick the point $p = (0.5,\, 0.5)$, and zoom in on what $H$ does near $p$.

![The camera stays locked on one dot while zooming in; the bent grid straightens into a perfect parallelogram grid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/07-the-microscope/microscope.gif)

The lines come out straight, parallel and evenly spaced, which is exactly what chapter 5 described. Up close, a bent polynomial map looks like a straight map.

> The **Jacobian** of $F$ at a point $p$ is the straight map you see when you zoom in on $F$ near $p$.

Different points show different straight maps under the microscope, so the Jacobian depends on where you look. (Computers find it by a mechanical rule, a small table of derivatives. You will never compute one by hand here; the computer does it in chapter 10.)

This matters because straight maps have a determinant, an area factor. At **every point** $p$, the map therefore has a *local area factor*, written $\det J_F(p)$, which is the determinant of the straight map seen under the microscope at $p$. It says how strongly $F$ stretches or squeezes *tiny* pieces right at $p$, and whether it flips them. The next figure paints this number over the whole plane for two maps and sends a probe dot to read it out.

![A probe dot wanders over two heatmaps: over the shear its readout stays 1, over the fold it reads 2x and hits 0 on the fold line](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/07-the-microscope/det_heatmaps.gif)

- The shear $(x + y^2, y)$ has local area factor **exactly 1 at every point**. At every location, under every zoom, it is a perfect area-preserving straight map. That is the precise meaning of "bends but never crushes".
- The fold $(x^2, y)$ has local area factor $2x$. It is positive on the right half (blue), negative on the left half where that half got flipped (red), and exactly zero on the fold line. The picture shows exactly where the map destroys information.

> **The one thing to remember:** zoom in anywhere on a smooth map and you see a straight map, the Jacobian at that point. Its determinant is the local area factor, and the places where this factor is 0 are exactly the places where the map crushes.

---

## 8 · Local vs global

The microscope looks like the perfect tool, but a map can look healthy under every microscope and still be broken as a whole. That gap is the central difficulty of the subject, and this chapter shows where it comes from.

The tempting shortcut runs like this. To know whether a map can be undone, check the local area factor everywhere, and if it is never zero then the map never crushes anything, so it should be undoable. The rest of the chapter tests that reasoning.

Part of the reasoning is correct. If the local factor at a point $p$ is not zero, then near $p$ the map can be undone, because zooming in far enough shows a healthy straight map. This fact is called the *inverse function theorem*, and it is solid. What it does not promise is anything about points that lie far apart.

Take the polynomial map $F(x, y) = (x^2 - y^2,\; 2xy)$ and apply it to a ring around the center. The blue half is on the right, and the gold half is on the left.

![Two half-rings, blue and gold, each smoothly map onto the same full ring, interleaving](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/08-local-vs-global/wrap.gif)

Each half maps smoothly, with no creases and no crushing, and the microscope finds nothing wrong near any single point. The blue half nevertheless covers the **entire** target ring, and the gold half covers **the same ring again**, so every target point is hit **twice**, by two points far away from each other. That is why the blue and gold dots meet in the animation.

These are collisions, but not local ones, because each collision pairs two points from opposite sides of the plane and no microscope can see both at once. The map is therefore fine locally everywhere and broken as a whole.

The bad points behind this are worth counting. On the whole plane, this map's local area factor is $4(x^2 + y^2)$.

![A probe spirals inward, its readout shrinking until it hits exactly 0 at the origin, the only bad point](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/08-local-vs-global/one_bad_point.gif)

It is zero at **one single point**, the center, and nonzero everywhere else. One bad point out of infinitely many is enough for the map to wrap the plane around twice, which shows how little it takes to break undoability.

It is worth being careful about what this example proves. This map *has* a zero, so it fails the shortcut's own test, and the shortcut never promised anything about it. What the example really shows is the **shape of the danger**: collisions pair up points from opposite sides of the plane, far outside any microscope's view, because the microscope is a local tool while undoability is a global question.

The shortcut also fails in its strongest form. Asking the local factor to avoid zero at *every* point, with no exception at all, still does not force the map to be undoable, because there are maps whose local factor is nonzero everywhere and that still send two faraway points to the same spot. Chapter 11 shows a famous one, built entirely from polynomials: its factor is positive at every point of the plane, and it has a collision anyway. For smooth maps that are not polynomials the behavior is worse, since some of them hit target points infinitely often.

A local factor that is never zero is therefore not enough on its own, even when it holds everywhere. A local condition that guarantees a global undo has to ask for more, and Keller asked for the strongest local condition available: the local area factor must be **the same constant at every point**, not just nonzero, and the map must be **polynomial**. Whether that is enough is the Jacobian Conjecture, which the next chapter states in full.

> **The one thing to remember:** the microscope only checks a map near each point. Points far apart can still collide, so local undoability everywhere does not give global undoability.

---

## 9 · The conjecture

You now have every piece:

1. **Undoable** means no collisions and no gaps (chapter 2).
2. **Polynomial maps** are machines built from plus and times only (chapters 3 and 4).
3. **Determinant** is the area factor of a straight map, where zero means crushed (chapter 5).
4. **Jacobian** is the straight map seen under the microscope, and $\det J$ is the local area factor at each point (chapter 7).
5. **The trap** is that a nonzero local factor everywhere still does not force global undoability (chapter 8).

Keller's question, from 1939, does not merely ask the local area factor to avoid zero. It asks the factor to be **the same nonzero constant at every single point**, as it is for the shear and the stacked shears, where the factor is exactly 1 everywhere, and it keeps the maps polynomial, the simplest machines there are. What it then asks is whether those conditions force the map to be undoable, with a polynomial undo.

> **The Jacobian Conjecture** (Keller, 1939)
>
> Take any polynomial map, in any dimension.
> Suppose its local area factor is the same nonzero constant at every point.
> **Then the map can be undone, and its undo is also a polynomial map.**

The animation below shows the same question in motion. It applies the condition first and then asks the question.

![A polynomial map tangles the grid while a yellow patch keeps exactly the same area; then the motion reverses under the question](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/09-the-conjecture/conjecture.gif)

That is the **Jacobian Conjecture**. It was never a theorem, only a conjecture, meaning a statement that everyone believed and nobody could prove.

**Three details, for completeness:**

- **All dimensions.** The question is asked for the plane, for 3D space, for 4D space, and so on. Each output coordinate is a polynomial in all the input coordinates. Our pictures are 2D because that is what eyes can see.
- **Complex numbers.** Officially the conjecture is asked over the complex numbers, a larger number system where every polynomial equation has solutions. Over ℂ, "the local factor is never zero" and "the local factor is a nonzero constant" turn out to be the same condition. Chapter 11 shows that over the ordinary real numbers the conjecture is actually **false**, so this choice of number system genuinely matters.
- **Only collisions matter.** A deep theorem (Ax–Grothendieck) helps here, because it says that if a complex polynomial map has no collisions, then it automatically has no gaps, and its undo map is automatically a polynomial too. The entire 87-year battle therefore came down to one question, whether two different points can share an output.

The statement looked provable for good reasons. Every no-crush map we met satisfies the condition, with factor 1 everywhere, and can be undone. The next chapter shows that every example anyone ever built confirmed the conjecture, and that for degree-2 maps it was actually proved, which made the general statement look close to certain. Even so, nobody proved it between 1939 and 2026.

> **The one thing to remember, the Jacobian Conjecture:** if a polynomial map's local area factor is the same nonzero constant at every point, must the map be undoable, with a polynomial undo?

---

## 10 · Test it yourself

Before seeing what happened to the conjecture, you can test it with a computer that does exact algebra rather than approximations. Python's `sympy` library works with polynomials exactly, the way you would with a pencil and unlimited patience, and the [companion repo](https://github.com/muchmirul/conjectures/tree/main/jacobian-conjecture) wraps it in a few helpers. The session below uses the stacked-shear map $H(x,y) = (x + (y+x^2)^2,\; y + x^2)$:

```python
>>> from jacobian_guide.core import jacobian_det, invert, compose, degree
>>> from jacobian_guide.examples import VARS, TANGLED   # TANGLED is H

>>> jacobian_det(TANGLED, VARS)          # local area factor, symbolically
1
```

The answer is the constant 1. Algebra checked the formula itself, so this covers every one of the infinitely many points at once, which means $H$ satisfies Keller's condition. The next step is to ask for the undo map:

```python
>>> G = invert(TANGLED, VARS)
>>> G
(x - y**2, -x**2 + 2*x*y**2 - y**4 + y)

>>> compose(G, TANGLED, VARS)            # undo after do = ?
(x, y)
```

The computer returns an explicit polynomial undo, and the round trip simplifies to exactly $(x, y)$, the do-nothing map. Every point therefore walks back home, which is what the animation below traces.

![Step 1: the map H tangles the blue grid; step 2: its undo map G walks every point exactly back home](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/10-kicking-the-tires/roundtrip.gif)

By contrast, the fold $(x^2, y)$ has local area factor $2x$, which is not constant, so it never satisfied the condition and the conjecture makes no promise about it. Its failure to be undoable agrees with the conjecture instead of counting against it.

Decades of tests like this one produced the record below:

| map | local area factor | undoable? | degree, undo degree |
|---|---|---|---|
| shear $(x+y^2,\,y)$ | 1 | yes | 2, 2 |
| stacked map $H$ | 1 | yes | 4, 4 |
| triple-stacked $H_3$ | 1 | yes | 4, 4 |
| fold $(x^2,\,y)$ | $2x$, does not qualify | no | n/a |

Every example anyone ever built agreed with the conjecture. Theory added more:

- **Degree up to 2 was proved** (Wang, 1980): every degree-2 map satisfying the condition, in any dimension, can be undone.
- **Degree 3 contains the whole problem** (Bass–Connell–Wright, 1982): if the conjecture holds for all degree-3 maps, it holds for all degrees. The entire problem was compressed into degree 3, and still nobody could prove it.
- **In the plane, it was checked up to degree 100** (Moh, 1983, with computer help).

One detail is worth noticing. In the plane, the undo map always has the *same* degree as the map, while in dimension 3 and higher the undo can be far more complicated than the map itself. Higher dimensions behave differently in this respect, and that difference comes back in chapter 12.

> **The one thing to remember:** every example ever built confirmed the conjecture. Degree 2 was proved. The whole problem was squeezed into degree 3, and there it stayed unsolved for four more decades.

## 11 · Why it was so hard

Every test passed and the statement looked true, yet nobody could prove it, because any proof has to get past three separate obstacles at the same time. Those obstacles stopped 87 years of attempts, including published proofs by serious mathematicians.

This is the hardest part of the article, and it needs no new machinery. Every idea below is one you already have: machine, undo, collision, polynomial, local area factor. Each obstacle has the same shape, starting with a **hope**, meaning a natural plan for a proof, and ending with the **example that kills it**.

```
1884       Kraus claims a proof. It leaks at infinity.
1939       Keller poses the conjecture.
1955-61    A wave of published proofs. All wrong.
1980       Wang: true for degree 2 and below.
1982       Bass, Connell, Wright: degree 3 decides everything.
1983       Moh: true in the plane up to degree 100.
1994       Pinchuk: the real-number version is false.
1998       Smale lists it as Problem 16 for the new century.
2004       Nagata's map proved wild. 3D is stranger than the plane.
2026       Counterexample. False in dimension 3 and up. Plane still open.
```

The same pattern repeated for a century. Someone announced a proof, other mathematicians went through it, and a subtle hole was found. It happened to Kraus in 1884, before Keller even asked the question, to Engel in 1955, three times to Segre, to Gröbner, and to many modern attempts.

**Obstacle 1: the statement is false over the real numbers.** *The hope:* our pictures live in the ordinary real plane, so perhaps real-plane geometry already does the whole job, and a real polynomial map whose local area factor is never zero simply must be undoable. That hope does not survive one explicit example.

*The example that kills it:* in 1994, Sergey Pinchuk built an explicit pair of polynomials, of degrees 10 and 25. Their local area factor is **positive at every real point**, so it never touches zero anywhere, with no exception, and the map still sends two different points to the same place. In the figure below a probe reads the factor across the plane, and the running minimum dips low without ever reaching 0.

![A probe sweeps Pinchuk's log-scale determinant heatmap; the running minimum never reaches zero](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/11-why-it-was-so-hard/pinchuk_det.gif)

There is no crushing anywhere and no flipping anywhere, and there is still a collision. This is the map chapter 8 pointed forward to, and it shows that reasoning about real numbers alone can never prove the conjecture, because over the reals the statement is not true.

That leaves a natural question about why Pinchuk did not break the official conjecture as well. The official conjecture lives in the complex numbers, and Pinchuk's construction cannot survive there. His factor stays away from zero the way a sum of squares stays away from being negative, since the square of a real number is never negative and a sum of squares therefore never dips below zero. Complex numbers have no notion of "negative", so that protection disappears, and over the complex numbers any polynomial that is not constant hits zero somewhere. Pinchuk's factor is not constant, so over the complex numbers it would hit zero, and his map would no longer qualify. His counterexample works only over the real numbers, and Keller's question stayed open.

*(The details, if you want them: Pinchuk's factor equals $\det J = t^2 + (t + f\,(13 + 15h))^2 + f^2$ for certain helper polynomials $t, f, h$. That is a sum of three squares, so it is never negative, and a short argument shows it is never zero. The repo verifies the identity symbolically in `tests/test_pinchuk.py`.)*

**Obstacle 2: the statement is false in clock arithmetic.** *The hope:* polynomials are pure symbols, so perhaps pushing the symbols around with rules of algebra that hold in every number system is enough to prove the conjecture. This hope fails for a different reason from the first.

*The example that kills it:* clock arithmetic, where numbers wrap around like hours on a clock face. Take a clock with a prime number $p$ of positions. The simple machine $F(x) = x - x^p$ has constant slope 1, which is exactly the condition Keller asked for, and yet it sends *every* clock position to 0. Everything lands on a single output, which is the most extreme collision there can be. The figure below shows the collapse on a clock with 5 positions.

![Five numbers around a clock face all travel to position 0; the machine x minus x to the fifth has slope 1 yet collapses the whole clock](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/11-why-it-was-so-hard/clock.gif)

So the conjecture is false in clock arithmetic, and any proof must use a property that ordinary numbers have and clock numbers lack (*characteristic zero*, in the jargon). Pure symbol-pushing, valid in every number system, can never be enough.

**Obstacle 3: the danger sits at infinity.** *The hope:* a classical theorem, due to Hadamard, says that a map that is locally undoable everywhere, and that does not let points run away to infinity, is globally undoable. Perhaps polynomial maps cannot send points to infinity in a bad way, so that Hadamard finishes the job.

*The example that kills it:* they can. Under the crush map $(x, xy)$, take the points $(1/2, 2), (1/3, 3), (1/4, 4), \dots$, which run off to infinity themselves, while their outputs $(1/2, 1), (1/3, 1), (1/4, 1), \dots$ approach the ordinary point $(0, 1)$.

![Left: the input rides the hyperbola out of every window; right: its output slides along y = 1 toward (0, 1)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/11-why-it-was-so-hard/escape.gif)

The escape route to infinity is therefore open, and the behavior that decides the question happens near infinity. That is where the mistaken proofs, starting with Kraus in 1884, went wrong.

**One more warning sign: dimension 3 is stranger than the plane.** Every complicated undoable map we built was a stack of shears and straight maps, so until 2004 one could hope that all constant-factor maps, in all dimensions, are secretly such stacks. Stacks are always undoable, so the conjecture would follow. In the plane this is a true theorem, because every undoable polynomial map of the plane can be broken into shears. Three dimensions holds Nagata's map, which has local factor 1, a polynomial undo, and no bad behavior anywhere, and in 2004 it was proved (Shestakov–Umirbaev) impossible to build from shears and straight maps. Three-dimensional space therefore contains genuinely wilder maps than the plane, which is worth keeping in mind for the last chapter.

> **The one thing to remember:** a proof had to use all three at once: the maps are polynomial, the numbers are complex, and infinity is kept under control. Real-number reasoning fails because of Pinchuk, formal algebra fails because of clock arithmetic, and the escape to infinity is real. Almost no argument survives all three.

## 12 · The fall

In July 2026 the 87-year-old conjecture collapsed in every dimension except the one where it was born. This chapter shows the actual object that did it, and you can check that object yourself.

On July 19–20, 2026, an explicit counterexample to the Jacobian Conjecture in **three variables** was announced. The construction is credited to the mathematician Levent Alpöge, answering a version of the question raised by a colleague, and the final example was produced with the help of the AI model Claude Fable. At the time of writing there is no peer-reviewed paper yet, so this article does what mathematics always does with an announcement, which is to verify before trusting. Every claim below is re-checked, independently and exactly, by the companion repository (`tests/test_counterexample.py`), so nothing here has to be taken on trust.

**The map.** Write $u = 1 + xy$ as a shorthand. The map takes a 3D point $(x, y, z)$ to the 3D point $(P, Q, R)$:

```math
\begin{aligned}
P &= u^3\,z + y^2\,u\,(4 + 3xy) \\
Q &= y + 3x\,u^2\,z + 3xy^2\,(4 + 3xy) \\
R &= 2x - 3x^2 y - x^3 z
\end{aligned}
```

These are three short polynomials, of degrees 7, 6, and 4, with small whole-number coefficients. Two facts about them matter, and both can be checked directly.

**Fact 1: the condition holds.** Its local volume factor, the 3D Jacobian determinant, is exactly the constant $-2$ everywhere, which is precisely Keller's condition. The minus sign only means that space comes out mirror-flipped, uniformly, and the size of the factor never changes.

**Fact 2: the map still has a collision.** Three different points land on one single spot:

```
(  0,     0,  -1/4 )   →   ( -1/4, 0, 0 )
(  1,  -3/2,  13/2 )   →   ( -1/4, 0, 0 )
( -1,   3/2,  13/2 )   →   ( -1/4, 0, 0 )
```

The animation below shows it happening in 3D. Each point travels to its output, and all three paths end on the same red X.

![Three points in 3D space travel along dotted roads that converge on one red X at (minus 1/4, 0, 0)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muchmirul/conjectures/main/jacobian-conjecture/guide/12-the-fall/collision.gif)

Three different points arrive at one landing spot, so standing at $(-1/4,\, 0,\, 0)$ you cannot know which of the three you came from. This is the collision from chapter 2, and it rules out any undo machine. **The Jacobian Conjecture is false in three dimensions.**

It also fails in every higher dimension. In 4D, send the extra coordinate to itself, so $(x,y,z,w) \mapsto (P, Q, R, w)$. The volume factor is still $-2$ and the collision is still there, and the same works for 5D, 6D, and so on.

**Check it yourself, by hand.** The third coordinate is the easy one: $R = 2x - 3x^2y - x^3z$. Take the three points and plug in:

- $(0,\ 0,\ -\tfrac14)$: $\quad R = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0$ ✓
- $(1,\ -\tfrac32,\ \tfrac{13}{2})$: $\quad R = 2 - 3\cdot(-\tfrac32) - \tfrac{13}{2} = 2 + \tfrac92 - \tfrac{13}{2} = 0$ ✓
- $(-1,\ \tfrac32,\ \tfrac{13}{2})$: $\quad R = -2 - \tfrac92 + \tfrac{13}{2} = 0$ ✓ &nbsp; *(here $-3x^2y = -\tfrac92$, and $-x^3z = +\tfrac{13}{2}$ because $x^3 = -1$)*

Now take the first point in full. At $(0, 0, -\tfrac14)$ we get $u = 1$, so $P = 1 \cdot (-\tfrac14) + 0 = -\tfrac14$ and $Q = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0$. This point therefore maps to $(-\tfrac14, 0, 0)$, which is arithmetic you can do in your head.

**Check it yourself, by computer.** The other two points involve fractions like $\tfrac{13}{2}$ raised to powers. That is doable on paper, but exact algebra settles it in ten lines:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Matrix, Rational

x, y, z = symbols("x y z")
u = 1 + x*y
P = u**3*z + y**2*u*(4 + 3*x*y)
Q = y + 3*x*u**2*z + 3*x*y**2*(4 + 3*x*y)
R = 2*x - 3*x**2*y - x**3*z

print(Matrix([P, Q, R]).jacobian([x, y, z]).det().expand())   # -> -2

for pt in [(0, 0, Rational(-1, 4)),
           (1, Rational(-3, 2), Rational(13, 2)),
           (-1, Rational(3, 2), Rational(13, 2))]:
    print([f.subs(dict(zip((x, y, z), pt))) for f in (P, Q, R)])
# -> [-1/4, 0, 0]  three times
```

The repo's test suite runs the same checks in one command, `python -m pytest tests/test_counterexample.py -q`. It re-computes the determinant and re-evaluates the three points from scratch.

**What survives.** Keller asked his question in 1939 **for the plane**. The counterexample lives in dimension 3, and it needs the extra room, which fits the warning signs from chapter 11: maps that cannot be broken into shears exist only in dimension 3 and up, and undo-degrees only explode in dimension 3 and up. The plane case, meaning two variables and the original question, checked up to degree 100, **is still open today.**

**What the ending means.** For 87 years the question was which extra condition forces a map to be globally undoable. Everyone believed that "polynomial plus constant factor" was enough, and many wrong proofs of it were published. In dimension 3 and above it is **not enough**, because the escape-to-infinity obstacle from chapter 11 is real and can be exploited by polynomials of degree seven. The answer came from a counterexample rather than from a cleverer proof, and that counterexample is concrete enough that a person with no mathematical training can check it by hand, which is what the arithmetic above did.

> **The one thing to remember:** an explicit degree-7 map of 3D space has constant volume factor −2, yet three different points land on one spot. So the Jacobian Conjecture is **false in dimension 3 and above**, and **still open in the plane**, where it began.
