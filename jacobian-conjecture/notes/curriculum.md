# Curriculum design, "Zero to the Jacobian Conjecture"

**Goal.** A reader with no math background reads short chapters, looks at pictures and
animations, and ends up genuinely understanding what the Jacobian Conjecture says, and why it is surprising that nobody can prove it.

**Design principles** (to be refined by research notes in this folder):

1. **Picture first, words second, symbols last.** Every concept gets a visual before
   it gets a name, and a name before it gets a formula.
2. **One idea per chapter.** Each chapter is readable in ~5 minutes and ends with a
   single boxed take-away sentence.
3. **Simple sentences.** Short sentences. Everyday words. Jargon only after the idea
   already exists in the reader's head, introduced in **bold**.
4. **Everything is runnable.** Every figure/animation in the guide is produced by a
   script in this repo. Readers can tweak numbers and re-render.
5. **Honest math.** No lies-to-children that must be unlearned later. Simplify by
   omission, never by falsehood.

## The learning journey (chapter map)

| # | Chapter | The one idea | Flagship visual |
|---|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| 0 | Start here | A 1939 puzzle nobody has solved, and you can understand it | "scrambled grid" hero image + roadmap |
| 1 | Functions are machines | A function turns each input into exactly one output | number-line mapping animation |
| 2 | Undo: inverse machines | Invertible = no two inputs collide + every output reachable | arrow collision diagram (squaring loses the sign) |
| 3 | Polynomials | Machines built only from + and × ; tame and predictable | graph gallery |
| 4 | Maps of the plane | A 2D map moves every point of the plane at once | before/after warped grids (shift, rotate, shear) |
| 5 | Straight maps and the determinant | det = area-scaling factor; det 0 = squashed = information lost | unit square → parallelogram animation, det counter |
| 6 | Polynomial maps bend the grid | Polynomial plane-maps; some bend but never crush | shear (x, y+x²) bending animation; fold (x², y) non-example |
| 7 | Zoom in: the Jacobian | Up close every smooth map looks straight; Jacobian = the local straight map, det J = local area factor | zoom-in animation; det-J heatmaps |
| 8 | Local vs global | Locally undoable everywhere ≠ globally undoable | angle-doubling wrap-around animation |
| 9 | The conjecture | Keller 1939: constant nonzero det J ⇒ polynomial inverse? | statement card assembled from prior chapters |
| 10 | Kicking the tires | Verify it on real examples with the computer (sympy) | F then F⁻¹ round-trip animation; degree table |
| 11 | Why it was so hard | Pinchuk (real fails), char p fails, 87 years of attempts, known partial results | results timeline; Pinchuk det>0 heatmap |
| 12 | July 2026: the conjecture falls (in 3D) | An explicit 3-variable map with det ≡ −2 that is not injective; n = 2 still open | collision certificate the reader can check by hand + sympy |

Ends with "where to go next" pointers (van den Essen's book, surveys).

**Timeliness note (2026-07-20).** During the research pass for this guide we
learned the conjecture was disproved for n ≥ 3 *this very week*; the repo's
tests re-verify the counterexample's certificates independently
(tests/test_counterexample.py). The guide teaches the conjecture as history
demanded (chapters 1–10), then tells the ending honestly (chapters 11–12):
false for n ≥ 3 (announced July 2026, peer review pending), open for n = 2.

## Chapter template

1. *Promise*: "By the end of this page you will …" (one sentence)
2. *Picture/animation* immediately
3. Short explanation in simple sentences, interleaved with figures
4. *Try it*: command to re-render / tweak the figure
5. *The one thing to remember* (boxed sentence)
6. Link to next chapter

## Repo layout (target)

Folder-per-chapter (research: GitHub auto-renders each folder's README.md, giving
click-through navigation; media lives beside the text that uses it):

```
guide/NN-slug/README.md   one chapter per folder, PNG/GIF assets alongside
src/jacobian_guide/       core.py (sympy math), examples.py, plotting.py (matplotlib)
src/viz/                  per-chapter figure scripts (chNN_*.py), runnable standalone
manim/                    flagship manim scenes (optional, fancier renders)
tests/                    symbolic sanity tests for every claim about the examples
notes/                    research + this design doc
Makefile                  `make figures` / `make ch04` re-render media, `make test`
```

## Chapter writing style (ADEPT, from pedagogy research)

Each concept: **A**nalogy first, then **D**iagram/animation, then a concrete
**E**xample, then **P**lain-English statement, and only then the **T**echnical
symbols. GitHub math gotchas: use ```math fences for display math, avoid `|`
and spaces touching `$` in inline math, no math inside tables.

## Toolchain decisions

- **matplotlib + Pillow GIFs** are the workhorse: render everywhere, embed inline on
  GitHub, no LaTeX needed.
- **manim (Community Edition)** for the flagship scenes (grid morphs, zoom); use
  `Text` (Pango) rather than `Tex` to avoid a LaTeX dependency. ffmpeg is available.
- **sympy** computes every Jacobian, determinant and inverse that the guide claims, tests assert them, so the guide can't drift from the math.
- GitHub markdown renders `$…$` math; keep formulas few and small anyway.

## Correctness guardrails (facts the text must respect)

- Over ℂ, "det J F is a nonzero constant" ⟺ "det J F vanishes nowhere" (a
  non-vanishing polynomial is constant). Over ℝ these differ, Pinchuk's map has
  det > 0 everywhere yet is not injective, so the real version of the conjecture
  is FALSE with "nowhere zero", which is why the statement lives over ℂ / uses
  "constant".
- Char p > 0 fails: F(x) = x − xᵖ has F′ = 1 but is not injective (all of 𝔽ₚ maps to 0).
- Injectivity of a polynomial map ℂⁿ→ℂⁿ already implies surjectivity
  (Ax–Grothendieck) and the inverse is automatically polynomial, so the hard part
  is injectivity.
- Known: n = 1; degree 2 (Wang 1980); reduction to degree 3 (Bass–Connell–Wright
  1982); status: open for all n ≥ 2 (as of 2026).
- (Exact Pinchuk formulas, degrees, and further attributions: see research notes.)
