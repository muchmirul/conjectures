# 3 · Polynomials

*By the end of this page you will know which machines this whole story is about, the ones built from nothing but plus and times.*

## The simplest possible machines

Take an input $x$. Allow yourself only two moves:

- **add** (numbers or pieces you already built),
- **multiply** (numbers or pieces you already built).

Whatever machine you can build this way is called a **polynomial**.

- $2x + 1$: double, add one. Polynomial.
- $x^2$: $x$ times $x$. Polynomial. (A power is just repeated multiplication.)
- $x^3 - 2x$: build $x \cdot x \cdot x$, build $2x$, subtract. Polynomial. (Subtracting is adding a negative.)

Here is a family portrait, drawn as graphs, for each input $x$ along the floor, the curve's height shows the output:

<img src="gallery.gif" width="880" alt="The graphs of 2x+1, x squared, and x cubed minus 2x draw themselves as smooth unbroken sweeps; then the dashed gray impostors sin x, 1/x and root x appear, not polynomials">

The dashed gray machines, $\sin x$, $1/x$, $\sqrt{x}$, are **not** polynomials. Each needs a forbidden move: dividing by the input, or an infinite process. They are fine machines; they are just not in our club.

## Why the club matters

Polynomials are the machines you can run **exactly, with pencil and paper, in finitely many steps**. No approximations, no "undefined at zero", no infinite sums. They are the most concrete, most finite, most *checkable* machines in mathematics.

That is exactly why the puzzle in this guide is so embarrassing for mathematics: it is a question about the *tamest machines we have*, and it defeated everyone for 87 years.

The **degree** of a polynomial is its biggest power: $x^3 - 2x$ has degree 3. Keep this word in your pocket; it becomes important in chapter 10.

## Try it

```bash
python src/viz/ch03_polynomials.py
```

> **The one thing to remember:** a polynomial is any machine you can build using only plus and times. They are the most finite, checkable machines there are.
