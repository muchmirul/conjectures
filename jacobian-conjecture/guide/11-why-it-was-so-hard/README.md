# 11 · Why it was so hard

*By the end of this page you will know the three trapdoors that swallowed 87 years of proof attempts, including published proofs by serious mathematicians.*

## A graveyard of proofs

<img src="timeline.gif" width="900" alt="The timeline fills in event by event, 1884 to 2026: flawed proofs, Keller's question, partial victories, Pinchuk's warning, Nagata's omen, and the 2026 counterexample">

The pattern repeats for a century: someone announces a proof; the world gets excited; a subtle hole is found. It happened to Kraus in 1884 (before Keller even stated the problem!), to Engel in 1955, three times to Segre, to Gröbner, and to a steady stream of modern attempts. The conjecture earned a reputation as mathematics' most reliable producer of *almost*-proofs.

Why? Because any successful proof must squeeze through three trapdoors at once.

## Trapdoor 1: it is false over the real numbers

Hope: maybe ordinary real-plane geometry, the kind our pictures show, is enough to force undoability once the local factor never vanishes.

**No.** In 1994, Sergey Pinchuk constructed an explicit pair of polynomials $(p, q)$, degrees 10 and 25, whose local area factor is **strictly positive at every real point**… and which still sends two different points to the same place.

No crushing anywhere, no mirror-flipping anywhere, and still a collision. Real-variable reasoning alone can *never* prove the conjecture, because the real version of the statement is a lie.

<details>
<summary>How can we be sure the factor is never zero? (a gem, optional)</summary>

Pinchuk's local area factor obeys an exact algebraic identity: with his auxiliary polynomials $t$ and $f$,

```math
\det J = t^2 + \big(t + f\,(13 + 15h)\big)^2 + f^2
```, a **sum of three squares**, so it can never be negative; and a two-line argument shows $t$ and $f$ can't vanish together, so it is never zero. This repo verifies the identity symbolically: `tests/test_pinchuk.py`. The conjecture survives because Pinchuk's factor, while never zero, is not *constant*, over the complex numbers those would be the same thing (chapter 9), but over the reals they are not. The complex setting is doing real work.

</details>

## Trapdoor 2: it is false in "clock arithmetic"

Hope: maybe pure algebra, just formal manipulation of polynomial symbols, valid in any number system, can do it.

**No.** In arithmetic on a clock with a prime number $p$ of positions (add, multiply, wrap around), the innocent one-variable machine $F(x) = x - x^p$ has constant slope 1, the perfect Keller hypothesis, yet it maps *every* clock position to 0. Total collapse. So any proof must genuinely use a property that ordinary numbers have and clock arithmetic lacks (*characteristic zero*, in the jargon). Purely formal symbol-pushing cannot be enough.

## Trapdoor 3: the danger hides at infinity

Hope: a classical theorem (Hadamard) says a map that is locally undoable everywhere **and** doesn't let points "escape to infinity" is globally undoable. Maybe polynomial maps can't escape?

**They can.** Take the crush map $(x, xy)$ and the points $(1/2, 2), (1/3, 3), (1/4, 4), \dots$, they march off to infinity, while their outputs $(1/2, 1), (1/3, 1), (1/4, 1), \dots$ calmly approach an ordinary point. A sequence flees; its shadow stays:

<img src="escape.gif" width="820" alt="Two panels: on the left the input point (1/s, s) rides the hyperbola out of the top of every window as s grows; on the right its output (1/s, 1) slides gently along the line y = 1 toward the ordinary point (0, 1)">

So the escape hatch is open, all the interesting action happens "near infinity", and that is exactly where every naive argument, starting with Kraus's in 1884, silently leaked.

## And one more omen: dimension 3 is stranger

Every plane monster we built was stacked from shears and straight maps, and until 2004 one could hope all constant-factor maps, in all dimensions, were such stacks in disguise, stacks are always undoable, and the conjecture would follow. In the plane this is genuinely true (every polynomial undo-able map unstacks into shears, a classical theorem). But in three dimensions, Nagata's map, local factor 1, polynomial undo, perfectly nice, was proved (Shestakov–Umirbaev, 2004) to be **unstackable**: it cannot be built from shears and straight maps. Three-dimensional space contains genuinely wilder creatures than the plane. Remember *that* hint too.

## Try it

```bash
python src/viz/ch11_history.py
python -m pytest tests/test_pinchuk.py -q
```

---

> **The one thing to remember:** any proof had to use *polynomial-ness*, *complex numbers*, and *control of infinity* simultaneously, real analysis fails (Pinchuk), formal algebra fails (clock arithmetic), and compactness fails (escape to infinity). Almost nothing survives all three trapdoors.
