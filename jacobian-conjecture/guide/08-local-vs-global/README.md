# 8 · Local vs global

*By the end of this page you will see the trap at the heart of this whole subject: a map can be flawless under every microscope and still be broken.*

## A tempting shortcut

Chapter 7 gave us a dream tool. Want to know if a map is undoable? Check the local area factor everywhere. If it is never zero, the map never crushes anything, anywhere, so surely it can be undone…?

It *is* true that a nonzero local factor at $p$ makes the map undoable **near $p$**: zoom in enough and it is a healthy straight map, and healthy straight maps have undo maps. Mathematicians call this the *inverse function theorem*, and it is rock solid.

But watch what it does **not** promise.

## The wrap-around

Take the polynomial map $F(x, y) = (x^2 - y^2,\; 2xy)$ and apply it to a ring around the center. Blue half on the right, gold half on the left:

<img src="wrap.gif" width="560" alt="Two half-rings, blue and gold, each smoothly map onto the same full ring, interleaving">

Each half, on its own, maps beautifully, smooth, no creases, no crushing; near every single point the microscope reports "all clear". But the blue half covers the **entire** target ring… and the gold half covers **the same ring again**. Every point of the target is hit **twice**, by two points far apart from each other (the blue and gold dots crash).

Collisions, but not the local kind. Each collision pairs two points from *opposite sides of the plane*. No microscope, however strong, can see both at once. **Local health everywhere; global failure.**

## How many bad points caused this?

On the whole plane, this map's local area factor is $4(x^2 + y^2)$:

<img src="one_bad_point.gif" width="600" alt="A probe spirals inward over the heatmap of 4 times x squared plus y squared, its readout shrinking until it hits exactly 0 at the origin, the only bad point">

Zero at **one single point**, the center, and healthy everywhere else. One bad point out of infinitely many, and the map exploits it to wrap the plane around twice. That is how delicate this game is.

<details>
<summary>It gets worse (a glimpse beyond polynomials)</summary>

There are smooth (non-polynomial) maps whose local factor is nonzero at *every* point, with no exceptions, that still hit targets infinitely often, the plane gets rolled up like an infinite carpet. So for general smooth maps, "locally fine everywhere" is *hopelessly* far from "globally undoable". Whatever hope remains must come from using very special machines… like polynomials.

## The right question

So "local factor never zero" is not enough in general. If we want global undoability from a local condition, we need to bet on something extra. Keller's bet: demand the strongest local condition imaginable, the local area factor is not just nonzero but **the same constant everywhere**, and demand the map be **polynomial**. Is *that* enough?

That is the Jacobian Conjecture. Next page assembles it properly.

## Try it

```bash
python src/viz/ch08_local_global.py

> **The one thing to remember:** the microscope only certifies a map *near each point*. Far-apart points can still collide, local invertibility everywhere does not give global invertibility.
